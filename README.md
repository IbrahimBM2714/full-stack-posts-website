<h1>Full Stack website created using react, express, and mysql</h1>

CSS was not my main concern, which is why I didn't focus on it a whole lot. The main reason for this app was to learn nodes and express and how to integrate mysql with node applications.
</br>
The reason I used MySQL and not mongoDB was because I want to get better with relational database. It is because, I think that I can learn more with relational database.

<h3>What I used for this website</h3>
<ul>
  <li>React for frontend</li>
  <li>Node js and express for backend</li>
  <li>Sequelize package to help communicate with the MySQL databse</li>
  <li>MySQL as a database</li>
</ul>

A few interesting concepts I was introduced to by this project: Sequelize and Context variables in react.
